Nuxt + Koa
===========

A basic sample Nuxt application with Koa.

Koa handles the controller and the model as an API. Nuxt handles the view and calls the API, e.g http://127.0.0.1:3000/ (from Nuxt) will call http://127.0.0.1:3000/api (from Koa).

quick start
=============

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```
Then, access it at http://localhost:3000/
